# Utah Home Value Prediction
This is a basic Neural Network to predict the value of a Utah home by image. It's not currently working that great, but it gives some fairly reasonable predictions.

The neural network is a modified form of ResNet18 that intakes 640x480 images, and has been tested on an M1 MacBook Air.
